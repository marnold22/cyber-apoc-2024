Description: In the heart of an ancient forest stands a coloured towering tree, its branches adorned with countless doors. Each door, when opened, reveals a labyrinth of branching paths, leading to more doors beyond. As you venture deeper into the maze, the forest seems to come alive with whispered secrets and shifting shadows. With each door opened, the maze expands, presenting new choices and challenges at every turn. Can you understand whatis going on and get out of this maze?
